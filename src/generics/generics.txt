Why do we need to use generics?
    1. to reduce run time error
    2. to avoid type casting when we assign values...
    3. to reuse the same class, interface, methods, for different data types
    4. stronger type - checking
    5. code re-usability
    6. help us to improve code quality and to write clean code
